The surgrey will require the use of silicone oil which while in situ will leave him with reduced vision and he has been made aware that there is the real possibility of the oil being left in the eye long term. We have also explained that although the prognosis is very gaurded, if he opted for no intervention then this will result in the complete loss of sight in the left eye.

The additional problem is that he has very poor visual potential at present in the left eye with scarring itself secondary to rupture of his membrane of the cornea.

She is aphakic in the right eye.  Otherwise anterior segment examination was unremarkable.  Fundal examination revealed a large macular hole in the right eye which was confirmed today on OCT.  In the left eye there was no abnormality.  \r\r\n\r\r\nI explained to Mrs ######### today that the visual prognosis for the right eye was very poor given her  two failed macular hole procedures.  I have explained to her that this may sometimes be the case following macular hole surgery and that full closure cannot always be guaranteed.  I did however offer her the chance for a further procedure with silicone oil to see whether or not we could achieve macular hole closure.  I have however stressed that the visual acuity following this may continue to be poor or the surgery itself may fail.  She is willing to accept this risk and we plan to perform the operation in February under local anaesthetic.",

Her eye is settling down well and the vision feels brighter.  Unfortunately there has not been any improvement in the snellen acuity as the left eye is amblyopic.

She also feels the vision in the right eye is quite dull now.  Her left eye is settling well. There is a suture in the cornea but we will leave this until next time to remove.  I have listed her for right cataract surgery under local anaesthetic in view of the anisometropia and the fact that her right anterior chamber drainage angle is slightly narrow.

  "This 4 year old girl attended the clinic for a follow up visit after attending A&E on 29/6/2013. Her left eye surface is very inflamed. This is likely to be a reactivation of a herpes simplex virus infection; in addition, Anneliese has chronic lid margin inflammation (blepharitis), which makes her eye surface very vulnerable. Today her visual acuity in the left eye is reduced to 6/24; visual acuity in the right eye is 6/7.6. There is a dense opacity in the left central cornea, extending upwards. The epithelium is intact. \r\r\nThe best treatment for herpes simplex is an eye ointment, which is specific for use on the eye. I understand Anneliese's family have so far not used the ointment, because they fear it is too strong for the eye. Anneliese would benefit from this treatment, and it does not have any side-effects.\r\r\nBecause the eye is so inflamed and the epithelium is intact, I have also prescribed a mild anti-inflammatory eye drop. This MUST only be used when also using aciclovir. \r\r\nFor the blepharitis, I have recommended daily warm lid compresses and lid margin cleaning and have given Anneliese's father a leaflet to explain how to do these. We will review Anneliese in Mr ######## clinic next week.",

  "Diagnosis\r\r\nIntermittent left/alternating exotropia\r\r\n\r\r\nComment\r\r\nFreddie's family have noticed that his left eye wanders when he is tired. \r\r\nThere is no significant family history; his parents are not short-sighted.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn examination Freddie has very good unaided visual acuity of 0.00 logMAR in both eyes. On cover test he has a latent divergent strabismus (exophoria) when looking at a distance target; with near fixation there is a small intermittent left/alternating divergent squint (exotropia). His stereovision is reduced to 600 seconds of arc; Freddie found the test a bit tricky and this may be a performance issue and get better with repeated testing.\r\r\nCycloplegic refraction shows Right -0.50/+0.50 x 90, Left -1.00/+0.50 x 90. This is very close to no prescription at all, and as his visual acuity is very good and his control over the squint is very good, Freddie does not need glasses at the moment.\r\r\nOn fundoscopy, the optic nerve head and macula are healthy in both eyes.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn summary, Freddie has intermittent exotropia with good control, as his parents only notice it when he is tired. Freddie may become short-sighted in the future, and may benefit for glasses to see the whiteboard at school.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe does not need any treatment for exotropia at the moment. Future visits will continue to monitor his visual acuity, stereovision and controlled binocular acuity as a measure of squint control. Should treatment ever be required, glasses for shortsightedness can improve control. Surgery is a possibility, though the long-term benefits are unclear and often more surgery becomes necessary years after the first procedure.\r\r\n\r\r\nI have discharged Freddie from follow-up.",

  "Diagnosis:  Advanced keratoconus both eyes\r\r\n\r\r\nOutcome: Listed for penetrating keratoplasty right eye with a provisional date of 3rd July at St George's hospital in Tooting.\r\r\n\r\r\nScleral contact lens fitting for the left eye\r\r\n\r\r\nMany thanks for referring this 21yo woman with advanced keratoconus.

The left cornea is unscarred, and it may be that visual rehabilitation may be achieved with a scleral contact lens, although I understand previous attempts have failed.  I have nonetheless booked her in to see if we can fit scleral contact lens here.  \r\r\n\r\r\nI note that she has asthma and mild atopic conjunctivits today, but is otherwise well, and takes no regular systemic medication.  \r\r\n\r\r\nShe enquired about sight registration, and she is eligible for this, although it may well be in her interests to be registered more locally to her home.

We also discussed the option of conservative management, i.e. not doing surgery. \r\r\nBenefits: good chance of improving the vision if successful\r\r\nRisks: 1 in 1000 of severe visual loss due to an infection and 1 in 100 of operative complications which may require another operation or limit the vision permanently.\r\r\nWe will aim to correct distance vision after cataract surgery, however distance glasses are sometimes required after surgery to get the clearest possible vision. All patients will also require glasses for reading after surgery. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFollowing discussion of the risks and benefits we have listed the above patient for cataract surgery.",
  "Many thanks for asking me to see this gentleman with his left non-epithelialising corneal graft. He therefore underwent a left sided lateral and central prolene suture tarsorrhaphy on silicone bolsters which I hope will protect the graft and allow it to become epithelialised. When he looks to the right the graft can still be examined, and if necessary the central tarsorrhaphy can be removed once his graft begins to epithelialise.\r\r\n\r\r\nWith kind regards,",

She has become increasingly aware of the divergent squint, particularly when she is tired or had alcohol to drink. Her symptoms mainly occur when she is looking at a computer screen for long periods of time and when she is at university while taking notes during classes.
